### How to set up web server?

1. The app relies on two servers. The data server is a sails server provided by Udacity MWS stage 2 project. See item 2 and 3 to set up http server for static assets. Two servers must be running simoutaneously.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
